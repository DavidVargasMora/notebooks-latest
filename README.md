# notebooks_private
Set of Data Lab default notebooks, developed here, but not shown to the public from here.

There are two folders:
1- internal/ (only notebooks that we do not share with users, such as Manager versions that are documented elsewhere)
2- users/ (notebooks that we copy over to notebooks-latest/ for user accounts)

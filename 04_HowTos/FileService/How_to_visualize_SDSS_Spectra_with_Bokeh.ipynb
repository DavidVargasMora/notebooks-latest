    "[Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) is a library for interactive plotting.  We're going to try to plot some SDSS spectroscopic data.  In particular, we'll read BOSS/eBOSS [spPlate](https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX/RUN2D/PLATE4/spPlate.html) files that contain the flux *versus* wavelength data and match them up with [spZbest](https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX/RUN2D/PLATE4/RUN1D/spZbest.html) files that contain the best-fit redshift and model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Setup section below, we first load all the necessary code, then in the section Loading Spectra below, we actually start loading and plotting the spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is inspired by [the Inspector](https://github.com/sbailey/inspector/)."
